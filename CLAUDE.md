# YohanGwak - GitHub Profile Repository

Special GitHub repository that displays content on the profile page.

## Overview

This is a GitHub profile README repository. The `README.md` file in this repository is automatically displayed on the GitHub profile page at `github.com/yohangwak`.

## How It Works

GitHub treats repositories with the same name as the username as special profile repositories. The `README.md` content is rendered directly on the user's GitHub profile page.

## Structure

```
/
└── README.md    # Profile content displayed on GitHub
```

## Customization Ideas

The README can include:
- Personal introduction
- Skills and technologies
- Current projects
- Contact information
- GitHub stats widgets
- Pinned repositories
- Social media links

## Updating Profile

Simply edit the `README.md` file and push changes. The profile will update automatically.
